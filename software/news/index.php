                    <p>My Life My Way have been meeting with a number of Local Authorities across the UK to share knowledge about self-directed services and also to demonstrate the My Life My Way solution and how it can enable people with funding to be self-servicing.  All of our meetings have been fantastic and we thank the teams at the Local Authorities for being so welcoming and for giving their time to meet with us.  We look forward to whats next working with our UK business partners.</p>

We will be continuing our support for these organisations as we look to the future and further growth in self-directed services.</p>
